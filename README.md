# ft_printf
A miniature printf implementation, as specified by the Codam curriculum. Since the compuiler does not protect the function like the real one, it is up to the user to make sure that the input is correct, or risk undefined behaviour.

ft_printf handles the following conversions:
-c
-s
-p
-d
-i
-u
-x
-X
