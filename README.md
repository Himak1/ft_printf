# ft_printf
A miniature printf implementation, as specified by the Codam curriculum. The compuiler does not protect ft_printf() like the real printf(). This means it is up to the user to make sure that the input is correct, or risk undefined behaviour.

ft_printf handles the following conversions:\n
-c\n
-s\n
-p\n
-d\n
-i\n
-u\n
-x\n
-X\n
-%
