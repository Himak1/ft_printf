# ft_printf
A miniature printf implementation, as specified by the Codam curriculum. The compuiler does not protect ft_printf() like the real printf(). This means it is up to the user to make sure that the input is correct, or risk undefined behaviour.

ft_printf handles the following conversions:

-c

-s

-p

-d

-i

-u

-x

-X

-%
